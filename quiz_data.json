          ],
          "answer": "exponential",
          "explanation": "The traffic and residue in a rumor mongering algorithm typically exhibit an exponential relationship, implying very fast decay of 'residue' (uninformed nodes) and logarithmic message complexity, but the direct relationship between traffic and residue is an exponential decay/growth trade-off.",

          "answer": "S1 is true and S2 is true",
          "explanation": "Rumor mongering is a probabilistic protocol, so there is always a small chance an update doesn't reach a node (S1 is true). It is self-limiting because nodes eventually stop gossiping when they believe everyone is informed (S2 is true). ",
